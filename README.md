# PNR_Enquiry_IndianRailways
This project caters to the extraction of the status of PNR number (Passenger Name Record)  of Indian Railways. PNR number is unique to each and every ticket bought in the railways. With the help of it, we can get the exact details of the ticket in hand

This version is outdated now (a little while back), and the repo with the name PNR_Enquiry_IndianRailways_v2.0 is the main one being kept up-to-date
